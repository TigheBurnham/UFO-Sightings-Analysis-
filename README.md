# UFO-Sightings-Analysis-

## Overview of Project: 

The initial task was to help Dana build a webpage that could filter UFO sightings data by "date". The purpose of this project was to build upon the previous dynamic table to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by providing users the function to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date filter, users of the updated web page will now be able to filter the data by "city," "state," "country," and "shape." The overall purpose of this analysis consisted of a technical analysis that's purpose is to teach the power of JavaScript and HTML. 

## Results: 

Based on the project it is evident that JavaScript enhances HTML through visualizations and making websites more functional and dynamic. As previously stated, the first task was to build a webpage that could filter UFO sightings data by "date". This original webpage can be seen in the graphic below.

### Original UFO Sightings Webpage

In the above image we can see a new user could filter the date by day, month, and year. However, if a new user wanted to filter by "city" or "state" it would not be possible.

### New Updated UFO Sightings Webpage

As we can see from the image above the updated web page adds the new filter functions. 

### Results of the updated Webpage

The image above filtered the webpage by the city of Anchorage, as we can see the page properly filters the data. With the updated features a new user can now filter the data by "date", "city," "state," "country," and "shape".

## Summary: 

### Drawback
One of the drawbacks in this current design is that users can filter UFO sightings, but they can't sort the information. Sorting the information is a powerful option to develop analysis and to recognize patterns. Maybe there is a particular city where there are a lot of UFO sightings. Being able to sort would give the user the ability to gain more insight regarding UFOs. 

### Two Recommendations
A great development would be a  function that would allow users to confirm or verify a particular sighting. Tracking the amount of hits for a particular sighting would give the webpage the ability to filter and sort the table by the number of hits for a particular UFO sighting.

A second important recommendation would be the ability to leave a comment or upload a picture/video. When a user looks up a UFO sighting, having the ability to access supportive evidence for that event would be key. 

### Conclusion
There were three UFO sightings in San Diego, and two of them happened on January 1st, 2010. Currently, there is no ability to possibly gauge how many other people also saw these same sightings. Based on the population size of San Diego, there is probably a high probability that other people saw the same unidentified object(s). In this circumstance, users should be able to click a button that says they also saw this sighting so a tally is kept. Then they should also have the ability to leave a comment or upload some form of media in order to shed light on these sightings. With regards to UFO sightings a key objective is to gather as much information as possible in one place to either confirm or deny if the sighting is legitimate. Without the ability to do this de-legitimizes the purpose of the webpage.
